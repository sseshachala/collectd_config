the status script is a shell (bash) script that uses collectd notifications.

Since this information does not change often, the interval can be much
larger (1 day=86400)

<LoadPlugin exec>
        Interval 86400
</LoadPlugin>
<Plugin exec>
Exec "ubuntu" "/home/ubuntu/details.sh" "user"
</Plugin>

The first argument is the user to run it as (can't be root), the second is
the script (must be chmod +x), the third the customer login.

Use this json to make it:


OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output uses the collectd NOTIF format:

PUTNOTIF severity=okay time=$TIME host=$HOSTNAME plugin=server_data message=".."

if you send a notification, then the python reading script will add it to
database=xervmon_collectd_<customername>, collection=<plugin>

the 'message' field needs to be specially formatted. All of the message must
be on the same line. The format is like this:
key1: val1^key2: val2^key3: val3
that is, each record is separated by the ^ character. Use ':<space>' to
separate key and values. This will be turned into json:
{"key1":"val1", ...etc}
You MUST have a space after the :
You MUST have a field called "customer"
The message field MUST have "" marks around it.

Here is an example of the system status output:
PUTNOTIF severity=okay time=1363129600 host=ip-10-122-169-96 plugin=server_data message="system: Linux^customer: xervmon^arch: i686^dist: Ubuntu 12.10^host: ip-10-122-169-96^IP_eth0: 10.122.169.96/24^IP6_eth0: fe80::1031:38ff:fe0b:ca96/64^MAC_eth0: 12:31:38:0b:ca:96^"
